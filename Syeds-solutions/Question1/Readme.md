## Instructions for Question 1

Please note that I have used Postgresql and pgAdmin for this assignment.

1. The file "Question 1 - SQL Solution" contains the postgresql that you need to run to create your:
    - Database
    - Table
    - Load Data from the csv
    - Run a query to generate the desired output
    
2. The second file "TestCases.txt" contains the functions that I have created for testing our work. Please follow the instructions and run the scripts in this file in postgresql to test your table and document results.
