-- Production database design
-- Here we have 2 tables which are datamarts and then 2 derived tables called unique_providers and unique_clinicians
-- The derived tables contain only:
-- 1. Primary KEY
-- 2. id to match it to providers_mart and/or clinicians_mart tables
-- 3. NPI's with digits after the '-'
-- 4. Clinician's titles
-- 5. Filtered to contain only unique NPIs
